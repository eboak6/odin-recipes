    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, 
        meat or seafood, and vegetables.<br>With French and Spanish influences, 
        jambalaya is quite similar to paella. <br>
        The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the Provençal word 
        "jambalaia," which means mishmash.</p>
